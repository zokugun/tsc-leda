## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

## Users are not allowed to create Issues directly

Users are not allowed to create Issues directly in this repository - we ask that you create a [Discussion] first.

This project **does not use the issue tracker for discussion or feature requests**. Instead, we use GitHub [discussions] for that. Once a discussion reaches a point where a well-understood, actionable item is identified, it is moved to the issue tracker. **This pattern makes it easier for maintainers or contributors to find issues to work on since every issue is ready to be worked on**.

Any Discussion which clearly identifies a problem and can be confirmed or reproduced will be converted to an Issue by a maintainer, so as a user finding a valid problem you don't do any extra work anyway. Thank you.

[discussions]: https://github.com/zokugun/tsc-leda/discussions

## I have a bug! / Something isn't working

First, search the issue tracker and discussions for similar issues.<br />
Tip: also search for [closed issues] and [closed discussions] — your issue might have already been fixed!

> [!NOTE]
>
> If there is an _open_ issue or discussion that matches your problem, **please do not comment on it unless you have valuable insight to add**.
>
> Use the handy upvote button for discussions, and/or emoji reactions on both discussions and issues, which are a visible yet non-disruptive way to show your support.

If your issue hasn't been reported already, open an ["Issue Triage"] discussion and make sure to fill in the template **completely**. They are vital for maintainers to figure out important details about your setup.

> [!WARNING]
>
> Please make sure that you _only_ use the "Issue Triage" category for reporting bugs — thank you!

[closed issues]: https://github.com/zokugun/tsc-leda/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aclosed
[closed discussions]: https://github.com/zokugun/tsc-leda/discussions?discussions_q=is%3Aclosed
["Issue Triage"]: https://github.com/zokugun/tsc-leda/discussions/new?category=issue-triage

## I have an idea for a feature

Like bug reports, first search through both issues and discussions and try to find if your feature has already been requested. Otherwise, open a discussion in the ["Feature Requests, Ideas"] category.

["Feature Requests, Ideas"]: https://github.com/zokugun/tsc-leda/discussions/new?category=feature-requests-ideas

## I want to make changes

Small and trivial improvements can be submitted without any discussion.

**For non-trivial changes**, pull requests should be associated with a **previously accepted issue**.<br />
It's always better to ask for prior approval and discuss what you want to do before doing it.

Discussing that you want to do something doesn't put any obligations on you. If you don't want to start the discussion just because you're afraid that you won't do it. Don't be afraid!

> [!NOTE]
>
> **Pull requests are NOT a place to discuss feature design.** Please do not open a WIP pull request to discuss a feature. Instead, use a discussion and link to your branch.

### Code hygiene

When implementing features and bug fixes, please stick to the structure of the codebase as much as possible and do not take this as an opportunity to do some "refactoring along the way".

Similarly:
- **Make your changes** following our code standards
- **Test your changes** thoroughly
- **Update documentation** if needed
- **Commit your changes** with clear, descriptive commit messages

## Spread the word

Do you like the project?

* Spread the word in social networks!
* Talk about it to your colleagues and friends
* Write a blogpost
* Record a YouTube video

## Support the project financially

Supporting the project financially counts as a contribution (even if it's just a $1/month).
